# Hawli

An admin management system for our university.

This is a project from our Web Development 1 class. We were provided with a database which includes
the colleges and programs offered by the university. Our task is to create a management system that
utilizes CRUD, wherein we can create, read, update, and delete students, colleges, and programs with
these certain entities are related to one another. Backend development is coded purely in PHP.
